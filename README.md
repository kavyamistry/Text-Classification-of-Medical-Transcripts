# Text-Classification-of-Medical-Transcripts

In modern era, almost every domain has large amount of data. One of the most common is text data. The quantity of complicated documents and texts that demand a greater grasp of machine learning technologies to effectively identify texts in numerous applications has recently increased exponentially. Many machine learning algorithms have outperformed in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The ability of these learning algorithms to recognize complicated models and non-linear correlations within data is critical to their effectiveness. Many NLP experts have leveraged Text Classification methods for applications such as email classification, sentiment analysis, particularly in healthcare sector itâ€™s booming. Classification of clinical documentation, transcribing patient interactions and conducting conversational AI, analysing unstructured clinical notes, practice in Electronic Health Records (EHR) and so on are instances of what natural language processing can achieve. 

The majority of text classification and document categorization systems may be broken down into four stages: feature extraction, dimension reductions, classifier selection, and assessments.1 The aim of this project is to classify the medical transcriptions dataset into the speciality labels such as surgery, cardiovascular, neurology, etc.
